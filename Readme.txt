This codes are for Project of Comp5422.

All the libraries are shown at the begining of the code. 
In the environment of Colab, all the libraries should be ready to go.
If you are trying to run this code on other paltform like jupyternote book , check the libraries availablity first.

Model.ipynb:
In jupyter, you need to up load the data first, then use the link to get the file ready.
Run the code step by step.

Webcam.ipynb:
In jupyter, you need to up load the training result first, Switch different models with different h5 files.
Run the code, a window pop up with the camera images.
Press button 'b', to subtract background, and other 4 small windows would pop up.
Press button 'ESC' to quit.
 




And the rest part of the code should be ready to go by run them one by one.
